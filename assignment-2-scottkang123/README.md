Assignment 2
============

**Due: January 30, 2023 11:59 PM US Central Time**. Push to GitHub to submit the assignment.

In this assignment you are building a basic shell interpreter. It should read a command to be executed along with the command line arguments. To finish this assignment you will need to understand the usage of following systems calls:

- fork
- exec
- wait
- exit

Reading the input is already written for you in `main.c`, you need to complete the `execute` function in `shell.c` to actually execute the command entered. You should create the `build` directory and compile there with `cmake` as usual. A correct execution of the shell program will look something like this:

```
daniel@upsidedown:~/work/assignment-2/build$ ./shell
*** Welcome to the CS3281 Shell
CS3281$ ls -l
*** Entered: ls -l (2 words)
total 56

*** Child exited sucessfully
CS3281$ something
*** Entered: something (1 words)
*** Command not found: something
*** Child exited with 1
CS3281$ ls something
*** Entered: ls something (2 words)
ls: cannot access 'something': No such file or directory
*** Child exited with 2
CS3281$ exit
*** Closing the CS3281 Shell
```

## Tasks

* Finish the implementation of the `execute` function in `shell.c`. Do not modify, change or free the `args` array of input words.
* Select the appropriate `exec` function from the possibilities (see `man exec`). Use the manuals for the required system calls to find the appropriate include files. You might need `#include <sys/types.h>` to access the definition of `pid_t`.
* Make sure you print "Fork failed" if the fork function failed.
* Make sure you print "Command not found" if the exec function failed.
* Make sure you print "Command exited successfully" if the command terminated with a zero status code.
* Make sure you print "Command exited with" if the command terminated with a non-zero status code.

## Evaluation

Your assignment will be graded according to the following criteria:

- **25 points** for the correct usage of and error handling for the `fork` system call.
- **25 points** for the correct usage of and error handling for the `exec` system call.
- **25 points** for the correct usage of and error handling for the `wait` system call.
- **20 points** for the correct and appropriate usage of the `exit` system call.
- **5 points** for coding style, including 1) brief comments on complex portions of code, 2) consistent formatting, and 3) consistent and proper indentation.
- **10 extra points** if you can write a version of `execute` that waits up to 1 second for the child
to terminate then kills it (`man 2 kill`) only if it is still running. Do not continuously spin (`man usleep`).
